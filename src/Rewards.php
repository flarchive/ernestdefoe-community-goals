/**
 * The automatic rewards a goal can carry, each from an extension that may
 * not be there: a Wardrobe theme made the forum's default, a Festoon look
 * worn for some days, a FoF Badges badge for everyone who helped, and an
 * announcement discussion.
 *
 * 🚨 Each reward class names another extension's classes, so it is only
 * ever constructed after isEnabled() says that extension is on. A reward
 * whose extension has gone since the goal was set is skipped and noted, and
 * one reward failing never stops the others.
 *
 * Stored on the goal: `rewards` (what to do, cleaned by clean()) and
 * `reward_state` (what was done, so a timed reward can be taken back by
 * expire() and a deleted goal can undo what is still running).
