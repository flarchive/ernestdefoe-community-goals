/**
 * Every core (and optional extension) event that can change what a goal
 * counts, handed to Tally at the narrowest scope: a post, a discussion, or a
 * member. Tally re-checks that scope from the database, so each handler only
 * needs to say where to look, never what changed.
 *
 * 🚨 Counting must never break the thing being counted: a failure here is
 * logged and the post, like or sign-up goes through. The Recount button
 * repairs a goal that missed something.
 *
 * 🚨 And it never runs inside the transaction that saves it (core saves a new
 * discussion and its first post in one): counting locks goal rows, and a lock
 * conflict there (MariaDB 1020, a deadlock) rolls back the WHOLE transaction,
 * so the discussion was lost even though the error was caught (showcase,
 * 2026-11-12). Each count waits for the commit, and is dropped with a rollback.
