 * discussion or member when something happens; Recount runs it for the whole
 * window.
 *
 * 🚨 Only what an ordinary signed-in member can read counts: the queries go
 * through Flarum's own visibility scopes as a member with no extra groups.
 * So hidden and unapproved posts, private discussions and staff-only tags
 * never count, whichever extension makes them so, and a post that is hidden
 * and later restored counts again (the ledger makes both idempotent). The
 * thing has to happen inside the goal's window: a post or discussion is
 * dated by when it was written, a like by when it was given, a member by
 * when they joined. Nobody gets credit for liking their own post.
